# Memory Bank System Instructions

This project uses a Memory Bank system for maintaining context across AI assistant sessions. Follow these guidelines when working with this project:

## Memory Bank Structure

The project maintains a memory-bank/ directory with core documentation files:
- `projectbrief.md` - Foundation document defining core requirements and goals
- `productContext.md` - Project purpose, problems solved, and user experience goals  
- `activeContext.md` - Current work focus, recent changes, and next steps
- `systemPatterns.md` - System architecture and technical design patterns
- `techContext.md` - Technologies, development setup, and constraints
- `progress.md` - Current status, working features, and known issues

## Working with Memory Bank

When starting any task:
- Always read ALL memory bank files first to understand current project state
- Update relevant files when making significant changes or discoveries
- Focus particularly on activeContext.md and progress.md for current state tracking
- Create additional documentation files for complex features when needed

## Memory Bank Updates

Update the Memory Bank when:
- Discovering new project patterns or architectural decisions
- After implementing significant changes
- When user specifically requests "update memory bank"
- When context needs clarification for future sessions

## Response Style

- Provide concise, summarized responses
- Reference specific memory bank files when relevant
- Maintain clear documentation of decisions and patterns
- Focus on actionable next steps and current context

This system ensures continuity and effective collaboration across different AI assistant sessions.
