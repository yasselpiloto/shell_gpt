# Progress: ShellGPT

**What Works:**  
- CLI, chat, REPL, shell/code generation.
- Function calling, user roles.
- Request and chat session caching.
- Command safety (YAML config, user control).
- Modular handler architecture.

**What's Left to Build:**  
- **Question Mode (`??` Trigger):** [COMPLETED âœ…] Enhanced REPL functionality for asking questions without shell command generation.
- **Chain of Thought Reasoning:** [PLANNED] LLM-powered intent classification with visible reasoning steps.
- Context window condensation/summarization.
- Global memory (persistent, cross-session).
- Context window reset/management commands.
- Enhanced credential/sensitive info detection.
- UI/CLI for context management (view, trim, export).

**Current Status:**  
- Stable, extensible core.
- All major features implemented except advanced context/global memory.
- Safety and extensibility are robust.

**Known Issues:**  
- Context window can grow unbounded in long sessions.
- No global memory; all context is per-session.
- Credential detection is pattern-based, not semantic.

**Evolution of Project Decisions:**  
- Moved from monolithic CLI to handler-based modular design.
- Added extensibility for roles, functions, and safety config.
- Safety config is now user-editable.
- Focus shifting to advanced context/global memory and safety features.
- **NEW:** Question mode (`??`) implemented successfully for seamless Q&A in shell workflows.
- **PLANNED:** Chain of thought reasoning for enhanced user understanding and intent classification.

**Implementation Summary:**
- **Question Mode (`??` Trigger):** âœ… COMPLETED
  - Created `QuestionHandler` class with enhanced visual formatting (cyan text, indentation, `ðŸ’¡ Answer:` header)
  - Modified `ReplHandler` to detect `??` suffix and route questions appropriately
  - Added `add_message` method to `ChatHandler` for conversation continuity
  - Fixed double printing issue by overriding handle method to control output
  - Tested and verified in both default REPL and shell REPL modes
  - Supports mixed workflows (questions + shell commands in same session)
  - **COMPREHENSIVE TEST COVERAGE ADDED:** âœ… COMPLETED (31 total tests)
    - 10 unit tests for QuestionHandler (prompt cleaning, visual formatting, streaming, edge cases)
    - 10 tests for ChatHandler's add_message method (file ops, unicode, cache management)
    - 11 integration tests for REPL question functionality (context continuity, mixed workflows)
    - Fixed critical bug: system message establishment for new chat sessions starting with questions
    - All 62 project tests passing with 100% success rate and no regressions
